Sitecore.Octopus
================

An amalgamation of various open source tools to help with continuous delivery of Sitecore sites using Octopus Deploy. 


This program does the following:

1) Generate Release notes form Resolved jira issues and github commmit's, since the last production release in octopus deploy for your project. You can then pass this txt file into Octopus Deploy for your new release. so you REALLY do know what is being deployed.

2) Generate a .update package to be installed with Sitecore.Ship as part of your PostDeploy.ps1 script. The package of sitecore items is generated by comparing the current serilization folder with one that is tagged in the 'Github Releases'. ( There is a service for doing that in here as well).

3)Generates a  ItemsToPublish.json file, which you can pass into sitecore.ship to publish the new items automatically as part of your PostDeploy.ps1 script

There is a a Console app that you can call from your favourved scripting language (PSake example provided).


 It will generate 3 files. 
 1) ItemsToPublish.json ( for use with sitecore.ship )
 2) GeneratedContentPackage.update ( for use with sitecore.ship )
 3) ReleaseNotes.txt (for passing into Octopus Deploy)

# Arguments are:  seralization folder, Where you want package moved to, and git commit hash of current build ( can use GetCommitHash task example)
